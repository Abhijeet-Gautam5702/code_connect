# Code Connect Backend

This is the backend for a technical events hosting platform where users can identify and register for technical events like hackathons, tech-meetups etc. happening nearby. Users can also create or host their own technical events.

This project can serve as the starter codebase for any similar event-hosting and ticket-booking platforms.

This is a backend project built primarily using Node/Express and MongoDB/Mongoose.
